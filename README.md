# Evaluating USPSTF Breast Cancer Screening Guidelines for Impact on Black Women

## Research Question
Do the 2021 U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) breast cancer screening guidelines adequately address the risk profile and mortality disparities experienced by Black women in the United States?

## Goal
To produce a policy brief summarizing evidence and recommending revisions to the guidelines to promote health equity.

## Project Description
This repository contains a small-scale research and advocacy project examining existing cancer screening guidelines and their impact on minority populations. The focus is on breast cancer screening guidelines and their application to Black women, who face higher mortality rates despite similar incidence rates. The project uses a transparent, version-controlled workflow to analyze the guidelines, review literature, and draft a policy brief advocating for evidence-based changes.

## Methodology
1. **Literature Review**: Summarize key papers on breast cancer disparities, risk factors in Black women (e.g., earlier onset, more aggressive subtypes), and existing critiques of the USPSTF guidelines.
2. **Guideline Analysis**: Directly compare USPSTF recommendations (e.g., start biennial screening at age 50) with alternative guidelines (e.g., American Cancer Society suggestions) and evidence specific to Black women.
3. **Policy Brief**: Synthesize findings into a concise 2-page brief advocating for a specific change (e.g., recommending earlier screening for high-risk Black women).
